# Multi-omics-characterization-of-RNA-binding-proteins
## Highlights:
	Transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of 178 COVID-19 patients were profiled and analyzed.
	RNA binding proteins were likely to be perturbed in infection and interacting with viral proteins.
	Interactome analysis revealed that RBPs were likely to locate in central regions of network.
	Network analysis revealed disease comorbidities and potential drugs in COVID-19.
